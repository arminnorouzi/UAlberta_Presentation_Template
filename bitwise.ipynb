        "Bitwise operations are a group of elementary operations that deal with a binary number's constituent bits. These operations include left shift, right shift, bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and NOT. These operations are used to efficiently manipulate bits at the bit level and can be applied to tasks like determining whether a particular bit is set or clearing a particular bit. Bitwise operations are particularly useful in low-level languages such as C and C++, but are also available in high-level languages such as Python. Here is the operator of bit manipulation in Python:"

        "\n",

        "The last step of each iteration is to proceed to the next bit of `n` by using the bitwise right shift operator `n >>= 1` (or n = n/2). This effectively divides `n` by 2 and discards the least significant bit.\n",

This is because for each iteration, it is checking the next bit of n, which doubles the number of bits being checked. The space complexity is `O(1)` because the function only uses a constant amount of space, regardless of the input size.\n",

        "\n",
        "The above code defines a function `dec_to_bin(n: int) -> str` that converts a decimal number to its binary representation. The function takes a single argument n which is an integer, and returns a string containing the binary representation of the input number.\n",
        "\n",
        "The function starts by initializing an empty list called result and a variable i as `1 << 31`. The variable `i` is used to check each bit of the decimal number, starting from the leftmost (most significant) bit. The left shift operator `<<` is used to shift the value of 1 to the 31th position (i = 10000000000000000000000000000000 in binary) so that it can be used to check the 31th bit of the decimal number.\n",
        "\n",
        "The function then enters a while loop which will continue until i becomes 0. Inside the while loop, the function uses the bitwise operator `&` to check whether the 31th bit of the decimal number is ON or OFF. The expression `n & i >= 1` checks whether the result of the bitwise `&` operator is greater than or equal to 1, which means that the 31th bit is ON. If the condition is true, the function appends \"1\" to the result list. If the condition is false, the function appends \"0\" to the result list instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "After that, the function divides `i` by 2 using `i = i // 2` to move to the next bit (30th bit) and continues the loop until `i` becomes `0`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the function uses the `join()` method to join all the elements of the result list and return a string containing the binary representation of the input number.\n",
        "\n",
        "The time complexity is `O(log(n))`, where `n` is the decimal number being converted. This is because the while loop iterates `log2(n)` times.\n",
        "\n",
        "In each iteration, the function performs a bitwise operation and a comparison operation, both of which have a constant time complexity of O(1). Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(log(n))`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The space complexity is `O(log(n))` as well, as it creates a list of size log2(n) to store the binary digits of the input number. The space complexity of creating the list is `O(log(n))`.\n",
